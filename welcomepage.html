        <h3>Project Idea</h3>
        <p>One of my hobbies that I like to spend my free time enjoying is music production. Most of the time, I will
        start a song by creating simple chord progression on piano. Since I'm a relatively new piano player, I 
        don't always have the ability to just play a good sounding progression. Often times, I have to look up
        what chords can be played in a certain key, what are common chord progressions, etc. This website seeks to
        simpify that problem. The website automatically gives the user the available chords in a certain key and allows
        the user to create a full chord progression with just a couple clicks. It allows the user to save this progression
        so they can come back to it later also. 
        </p>
        <h3>How it works</h3>
        <p>The app is split into a frontend ui and a backend server like most web apps are. At a high level, 
            the front end sends requests to the backend based on what information it needs (ie: Chord information,
            user information) as well as put requests (delete and create data). 
        </p>
        <h3>Attributions</h3>
        <p>This app was built using Vue JS, and utilizes Heroku to host the backend, Google Firebase realtime
            database, as well as Google Firebase storage for storing my images and audio files. The audio files were generated 
            by me using <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/shop/live/">Ableton Live</a> and the images are from
            <a href="https://www.piano-keyboard-guide.com/keyboard-chords.html">Piano Keyboard Guide</a>. Additionally, 
            the app uses <a href= "https://github.com/tonaljs/tonal">Tonal JS</a> to query chord information.
