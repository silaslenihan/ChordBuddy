    <h1>Chords Project</h1>
    <hr>
    <h4>Idea</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>My Idea for the final project is to develop a web application that allows the user to easily
        create chords progressions. Basically, the app will take inputs from the users (ie: Key, number of chords, etc.) 
        and the webpage will then display matching chords. In music theory, a song is written in a "key" (sometimes more than one, but just one at a time). For simplicity's 
        sake, let's just say that a key tells the muscician which notes they can and can't play. Additionally, there are a set
        of chords that are valid in that key. This app would display all the valid chords, and allow the user to select which chords
        they want to use in the progression, and then they would be able to play back audio of that progression. A guest user would be able to make progressions,
        whereas a registered user could save these progressions, and download the audio. 
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h4>Scope</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>At the top of the page would be filter inputs for the specified chord set, and then the page would display 
        results, being a list of chords. These chords would all be selectable objects, and once a chord is selected it would
        appear at the bottom of the page as part of the chord progression. The user could then drag the chords around and play the progression
        as they please. I'm also thinking it might be useful to be able to download "MIDI" files containing the progression. A MIDI file
        essentially contains musical notes, when they are pressed, and how hard. So I think it would be cool to be able to directly
        download MIDI files to put into a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation.)

    <h4>Data Sources</h4>
    <hr>
    <p> 
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href= "https://www.piano-keyboard-guide.com/keyboard-chords.html">List of Chords</a> - I would probably have to 
                implement my own data structure for these, but I'm thinking a folder containing the chords that I could index into 
                would suffice.
            </li>
        <br>
            <li>
                Note Database - To actually construct the chords, I would need to either have a database containing pre-recorded chords or a 
                database containing individual recorded notes, and simply play all the notes in the chord together at once. Either way,
                I would probably manually record these through my own methods, and store the data within the app. I wasn't able to find a preexisting
                data source for either of these options. 
            </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h4>Data Structure</h4>
    <hr>
    Since all I have to store for this app is the pictures containing the chords, and the choresponding mp3 files, 
    I think a simple SQL data base would possibly work.
