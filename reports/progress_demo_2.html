        <h3>Data</h3>
        <p>This week, I decided to overhaul the structure of my backend pretty much completely. Instead of using the Scales Chords API,
            I have decided to host the sounds and images for chords on firebase and upload these
            files myself. Additionally, I am using the Tonal API to get chord information on the backend
            which will in turn tell the frontend which chords to display. It returns a simple array of chord names like so:
            <code>[ 'Bm', 'Csharpdim', 'Dmaj', 'Em', 'Fsharpm', 'Gmaj', 'Amaj' ]</code>. 
        </p>

        <h3>Progress</h3>
        <p>This was a pretty hectic week for me in terms of the Final Project. For the first half of the week I attempted to fix my issues with
            the Scales Chords API. Essentially my issue was that I couldn't get the chords to reload on the apge when the 
            underlying data structure was changed. I tried many different things, spent a lot of time in office hours and on piazza, and even 
            tried a Stack Overflow post. All of this was to no avail, so I decided to cut my losses
            and try a different method. I decided to upload my image and audio files to fire base (currently just images). I got my fire base 
            up and running and connected to the backend, as well as setting up my functioning Heroku server. Unfortunately I'm currently working running
            into a few issues with both of those, so the current state of the app is not showing much. However, I consider getting the firebase and heroku up 
            a big win, as well as finalizing my approach to the app. Once I iron out a couple issues I should be in a really good spot.

        <h3>Concerns</h3>
        <p>The major concerns for me right now are the issues I'm running into with Firebase and Heroku. I think I am close to getting them fixed,
            but simply due to time constraints I don't have them fixed for this progress report. I should have them fixed within the next few days and I should be in a good spot.

        <h3>Learning</h3>
        <p>I've definitely learned a lot this week, specifically about google authentification and firebase. I worked with traditional SQL
            databases a lot so its definitely been cool learning about a database like firebase.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Plan</h3>
        <p>Next week I plan to fix up the Firebase and Heroku issues I have, and move on to implementing the main functionality of the app. Hopefully I can Also
            start working on user authentication.
        </p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Overall, I feel pretty good about my progress and think I'm in a good spot to make a big jump in the coming week. I definitely have fallen a little behind
            with all the issues I ran into this week but I should still be on track to stay with my progress goals.
