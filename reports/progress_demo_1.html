        <h3>Data</h3>
        <p>The data I'm using in this project current comes from myself. The API I'm using works on the frontend, and does not actually
            return data to me, rather, I provide data to tell it what to display. The current data structure I am operating under is a list of JSON objects.
            Each JSON object contains information about a musical key, and the chords listen in that key. I pass that data to the frontend components which 
            use the scales_chords_api to display that list in chord form, as well as allow the user to play the sound the chord makes. Here is an example of the data structure:
            <br>
            <code>json_data = {
                "C": {
                    "chords": ["Cmaj","Dm","Em","Fmaj","Gmaj","Am","Bdim7"]
                },
                "D": {
                    "chords": ["Dmaj","Em","Fm","Gmaj","Amaj","Bm","Cdim7"]
                },
                "E": {
                    "chords": ["Emaj","Fm","Gm","Amaj","Bmaj","Cm","Ddim7"]
                },
                "F": {
                    "chords": ["Fmaj","Gm","Am","Bmaj","Cmaj","Dm","Edim7"]
                }
            }</code>
            Right now, this is only a sample of the data and when the full dataset is done, it will have 12 scales total with probably 10-20 chords in each. 
        </p>

        <h3>Progress</h3>
        <p>This week I made a lot of progress. I set up the whole project, front and back end (but I haven't deployed the backend yet on Heroku) and began
            implementing my front end. I got the Scales Chords API to work, and began trying to add more functionality. I spent most of my time mapping out 
            the best way to structure my data, and thinking about how I want to have the different parts of my project interact. Right now, I'm able to play
            chords just as I want to which was a major win in my book. The Scales Chords API is pretty awesome despite a few pitfalls that I'm trying to work around
            right now.

        <h3>Concerns</h3>
        <p>A major concern I have is that the reactivity with the Scales Chords API seems to be broken / not working for me. I'm able to confirm that I am
            corrently altering the prop that the API references, and the page loads initially as intended, but whenever I alter the key all the chords go away 
            and I'm not sure why. I've contacted the creators of the API for support, and I intend to go to Office Hours ASAP to fix this issue. 
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Plan</h3>
        <p>Next week I am going to focus on fixing that issue, instantiating the rest of my data, launching the backend on Heroku, and starting to create my login framework</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Overall, I feel great about my progress. The Scales Chords API was a huge find for me, and if I'm able to get it working fully will be awesome. Also, I feel
            really good about the goals I've set for myself as I'm very confident in being able to get them done on time. Overall, I'm excited!
